# Project Name

Using the provided Wireframe as a blueprint, we've created a React App that encompasses the following features:

Navigation Bar: The app features a top navigation bar for easy navigation.

Dynamic Hero Section: The Hero Section dynamically adjusts its background color based on the system theme, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Interactive Icon Section: There are four clickable icons within the app. When clicked, these icons mirror their selection in the header, providing visual feedback to users.

User Input Form: A user-friendly form is available with two input fields. When users submit the form, the data is logged to the console for further processing.

Notification Bar: The Notification Bar is an integral part of the app, initially displaying a welcoming message upon page loading. Additionally, it serves as a conduit for conveying success messages from form submissions.
